# Games For Potatoes

A set of easy console based games designed to maximize speed and battery efficiency.

This repository is not intended to house the source code for the games, but instead is where you can find release-ready binaries for the finished games, as well as potatoes.exe, which neatly packages together all of the games into one executable.
